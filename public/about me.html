            A full-stack developer is someone with the ability to work on all “layers” of software development.
            The three layers of a standard web application are:
            Presentation layer.
            Business layer.
            Database layer.
            Although full-stack developers are usually capable of working with each layer, they’re not necessarily
            expertson any one in particular.Generally, the main areas a full-stack developer focuses on are divided into two:
            Front-End Development and Back-End Development </article>

                First things first: 
             What do UX and UI actually mean?
             The people you have eavesdropped on are actually discussing two professions that,
            despite having been around for decades, and in theory for centuries, have been defined by the tech industry as UX and UI 
            design.UX design refers to the term “user experience design”, while UI stands for “user interface design”. Both elements are crucial to a product and work closely together. 
            But despite their professional relationship, the roles themselves are quite different, referring to very different aspects of the product development process and the
            design discipline. Before we consider the key differences between UX and UI, let’s first define what each term means individually.

               <b> Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
                It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),
                meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. 
                Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. 
                The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2019, 
                Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,particularly for 
                client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems
                (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.
                 The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. 
                 As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the 
                 GNU General Public License. Meanwhile, others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler),
                GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).
                The latest versions are Java 14, released in March 2020, and Java 11, a currently supported long-term support (LTS) version, 
                released on September 25, 2018; Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use, 
                while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020.
                 Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling older versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security 
                 issues. Since Java 9, 10, 12 and 13 are no longer supported, Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the 
                 latest version (currently Java 14) or an LTS </b>
